## Why MathInk exists

Studying works best when you can do three things consistently:

- **Collect good questions** (and keep them organized)
- **Practice in small, targeted sessions** (with explanations)
- **Simulate exam conditions** (so performance matches preparation)

MathInk brings all of this into a single, distraction-free desktop experience.

## Made for

- **Students**
  - Build confidence with daily practice

## The core workflow

MathInk is designed around a simple loop:

1. **Create** questions
2. **Organize** them into modules
3. **Practice** until concepts feel easy
4. **Test** under timed conditions
5. **Review** mistakes and repeat

Over time, this turns your question bank into a study engine.

## Question bank (your library)

Your question bank is your foundation — MathInk keeps it clean, searchable, and easy to expand.

- **Create and edit questions** as your syllabus grows
- **Use tags** to group questions by chapter, topic, difficulty, or source
- **Maintain quality** by improving wording and explanations over time
- **Reuse questions** in multiple modules without re-creating anything

---

## Practice mode (daily learning)

Practice mode is built for learning.

- **Practice by topic** when you’re learning something new
- **Mixed practice** when you’re revising across chapters
- **Explanations that teach**
  - Not just the final answer
  - The reasoning and method behind it
- **Smooth flow**
  - Minimal friction between questions
  - More time thinking, less time clicking

### The goal of practice mode

Practice mode is not about getting a score once.

It’s about:

- making concepts automatic
- catching patterns in mistakes
- building speed without rushing

---

## Exam mode (real test simulation)

Exam mode is built for performance.

- **Timed sessions** to simulate pressure
- **Exam-style flow** to maintain focus
- **Attempt history** so you can see progress and consistency
- **Review after submission** to find exactly what went wrong

### The goal of exam mode

Exam mode helps you answer two important questions:

- Can you solve it **correctly**?
- Can you solve it **on time**?

---

## Review & improvement

The most valuable part of studying is reviewing.

MathInk helps you:

- **Revisit incorrect answers**
- **Understand the explanation** (instead of memorizing the result)
- **Practice the same topic again** until it becomes easy

---

## Organization (modules + tags)

As your library grows, organization becomes everything.

- **Modules** help you bundle questions into meaningful sets
  - chapter sets
  - revision sets
  - full-length mock tests

- **Tags** help you search and filter fast
  - topic
  - difficulty
  - exam year
  - source book

---

## Backup & portability

Your study library is valuable.

MathInk supports:

- **Exporting your data** (for backups)
- **Importing data** (to restore or move to another machine)
